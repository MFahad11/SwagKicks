It’s set against a blue and red upper that mixes suede, leather and mesh while a sculpted midsole juts out past the heel, adding an extra element of crazy design lines on an already chaotic shoe. The classic waffle outsole brings everything together, while Nike and Sacai branding can be seen on the back heel and insole.</p>\n"
